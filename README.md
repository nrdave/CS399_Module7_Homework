CS399 Module 7: ai Exploring Neural Word Embeddings with Python
# Assignment

Finding outliers in a list of words.
"outliers - things differing from all other members of a particular group or set"
Utilizing what you have learned in this module, 
write a short program that uses a pre-trained Word2Vec model to remove outliers 
from a list of given words. You could start your program like this:

```
"""
    Remove Outliers from a list of words
    Author: John Doe
"""
from wv import Model
from scipy.stats import zscore

model = Model("models/glove_short.txt")
while True:
    words = input("Please enter a comma separated list of words: ").split("")
```

You could end the program if less than 3 words were provided
or a vector representation of a word could not be found in the model.

Please limit additional imports und use pythonic code
Try different models and a comment wrt why you picked the one in your submission. 
As a very minimum, I would expect an output like this:

```
Loading model from models/glove_short.txt ...
Loaded in 5.019477 secs
Please enter a comma separated list of words: >? apple banana mango car
With outliers removed your list looks like this: apple banana mango.
Please enter a comma separated list of words: >? apple banana mango car pizza
With outliers removed your list looks like this: apple banana mango pizza.
Please enter a comma separated list of words: >? apple banana mango orange car bus cherry
With outliers removed your list looks like this: apple banana mango orange cherry.
Please enter a comma separated list of words: >?
```

EXTRA CREDIT is available if your app has a streamlit UI
