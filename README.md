# CS399 Module 7: Exploring Neural Word Embeddings with Python

This repo contains the code for my CS 399 course assignment 7. This assignment
involves determining an outlier in a series of words based on a distributed
vector word model - this program specifically uses the first 50,000 words in
Stanfordâ€™s GloVe Vector Set.
